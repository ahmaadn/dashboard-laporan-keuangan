# Laravel Boost

## Tools

Laravel Boost is an MCP server with tools designed specifically for this application. Prefer Boost tools over manual alternatives like shell commands or file reads.

- `database-query` — run read-only queries against the database instead of writing raw SQL in tinker.
- `database-schema` — inspect table structure before writing migrations or models.
- `get-absolute-url` — resolve the correct scheme, domain, and port for project URLs. Always use this before sharing a URL with the user.
- `browser-logs` — read browser logs, errors, and exceptions. Only recent logs are useful; ignore old entries.

## Searching Documentation (IMPORTANT)

- **Always use `search-docs` before making code changes.** Do not skip this step. It returns version-specific docs based on installed packages automatically.
- Pass a `packages` array to scope results when you know which packages are relevant.
- Use multiple broad, topic-based queries: `['rate limiting', 'routing rate limiting', 'routing']`. Expect the most relevant results first.
- Do **not** add package names to queries — package info is already shared. Use `test resource table`, not `filament 4 test resource table`.

### Search Syntax

1. Words give auto-stemmed AND logic: `rate limit` matches both "rate" AND "limit".
2. `"quoted phrases"` for exact position matching: `"infinite scroll"` requires adjacent words in order.
3. Combine words and phrases for mixed queries: `middleware "rate limit"`.
4. Use multiple queries for OR logic: `queries=["authentication", "middleware"]`.

## Artisan

- Run Artisan commands directly via the command line (e.g., `php artisan route:list`).
- Use `php artisan list` to discover available commands and `php artisan [command] --help` to check parameters.
- Inspect routes with `php artisan route:list`. Filter with: `--method=GET`, `--name=users`, `--path=api`, `--except-vendor`, `--only-vendor`.
- Read configuration values using dot notation: `php artisan config:show app.name`, `php artisan config:show database.default`. Or read config files directly from `config/`.

## Tinker

- Execute PHP in app context for debugging and testing code.
- Do **not** create models without user approval — prefer tests with factories instead.
- Prefer existing Artisan commands over custom tinker code.
- Always use single quotes to prevent shell expansion: `php artisan tinker --execute 'Your::code();'`
  - Use double quotes for PHP strings inside: `php artisan tinker --execute 'User::where("active", true)->count();'`
